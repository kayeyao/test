Vaccines General Info,WHO,3/30/2021,Is there a vaccine for COVID-19?,"There are now several vaccines that are in use. The first mass vaccination programme started in early December 2020 and as of 15 February 2021, 175.3 million vaccine doses have been administered. At least 7 different vaccines (3 platforms) have been administered. WHO issued an Emergency Use Listing (EULs) for the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine (BNT162b2) on 31 December 2020. On 15 February 2021, WHO issued EULs for two versions of the AstraZeneca/Oxford COVID-19 vaccine, manufactured by the Serum Institute of India and SKBio. WHO is on track to EUL other vaccine products through June.The products and progress in regulatory review by WHO is provided by WHO and updated regularly. Once vaccines are demonstrated to be safe and efficacious, they must be authorized by national regulators, manufactured to exacting standards, and distributed. WHO is working with partners around the world to help coordinate key steps in this process, including to facilitate equitable access to safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines for the billions of people who will need them.

Vaccines General Info,CDC,3/30/2021,How do vaccines work?,"To understand how COVID-19 vaccines work, it helps to first look at how our bodies fight illness. When germs, such as the virus that causes COVID-19, invade our bodies, they attack and multiply. This invasion, called an infection, is what causes illness. Our immune system uses several tools to fight infection. The first time a person is infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, it can take several days or weeks for their body to make and use all the germ-fighting tools needed to get over the infection. After the infection, the person’s immune system remembers what it learned about how to protect the body against that disease. COVID-19 vaccines help our bodies develop immunity to the virus that causes COVID-19 without us having to get the illness. Different types of vaccines work in different ways to offer protection. But with all types of vaccines, the body is left with a supply of “memory” T-lymphocytes as well as B-lymphocytes that will remember how to fight that virus in the future. Sometimes after vaccination, the process of building immunity can cause symptoms, such as fever. These symptoms are normal and are signs that the body is building immunity."

Vaccines General Info,DOH,3/31/2021,How do vaccines differ?,"Vaccines differ in their composition and how they trigger the immune response to create antibodies. These antibodies protect the body from microorganisms and serve as protection once a person gets infected with disease. Vaccines can be inactivated, weakened or killed copies of the whole or part of the virus or bacteria, or genetic product (like mRNA vaccines) that creates protein copies without causing disease."

Vaccines General Info,CDC,3/30/2021,Can a COVID-19 vaccine make me sick with COVID?,"None of the authorized and recommended COVID-19 vaccines or COVID-19 vaccines currently in development contain the live virus that causes COVID-19. This means that a COVID-19 vaccine cannot make you sick with COVID-19. There are several different types of vaccines in development. All of them teach our immune systems how to recognize and fight the virus that causes COVID-19. Sometimes this process can cause symptoms, such as fever. These symptoms are normal and are a sign that the body is building protection against the virus that causes COVID-19."

Vaccines General Info,CDC,3/30/2021,"After getting a COVID-19 vaccine, will I test positive for COVID-19 on a viral test?","Neither the recently authorized and recommended vaccines nor the other COVID-19 vaccines currently in clinical trials in the United States can cause you to test positive on viral tests, which are used to see if you have a current infection.​ If your body develops an immune response—the goal of vaccination—there is a possibility you may test positive on some antibody tests. Antibody tests indicate you had a previous infection and that you may have some level of protection against the virus. Experts are currently looking at how COVID-19 vaccination may affect antibody testing results."
Vaccines General Info,CDC,3/30/2021,Will a COVID-19 vaccine alter my DNA?,"COVID-19 vaccines do not change or interact with your DNA in any way. There are currently two types of COVID-19 vaccines that have been authorized for use in the United States: messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines and viral vector vaccines. At the end of the process, our bodies have learned how to protect against future infection from COVID-19. That immune response and the antibodies that our bodies make protect us from getting infected if the real virus enters our bodies."
Vaccines General Info,DOH,3/30/2021,How can I protect myself from getting exposed to COVID-19 even after the vaccination?,"Even if the vaccine protects from symptomatic, and moderate to severe forms of COVID-19, you can add protection by doing the BIDA behaviors: Wearing of Mask and Face Shield, Wash/Sanitize Hands, Avoid Crowded Places, Ensure good ventilation, and Maintain 1 meter distance."

Vaccines General Info,DOH,3/29/2021,How can I help stop the spread of COVID-19 even after vaccination?,"Even if you've already received your first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, you can prevent the spread of the virus to your family and community through the following: stay at home unless travel is essential; open windows and ensure proper ventilation and air circulation at home or your place of work; maintain a balanced and healthy diet; exercise, and avoid smoking and alcohol; monitor your health and call your Barangay Health Emergency Response Team if you have symptoms and possible exposure to the virus."
Vaccines General Info,WHO,3/29/2021,Will other vaccines help protect me from COVID-19?,"Currently, there is no evidence that any other vaccines, apart from those specifically designed for the SARS-Cov-2 virus, will protect against COVID-19. However, scientists are studying whether some existing vaccines such as the Bacille Calmette-Gurin (BCG) vaccine, which is used to prevent tuberculosis are also effective for COVID-19. WHO will evaluate evidence from these studies when available."
Vaccines General Info,DOH,3/31/2021,What is an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA)?,"It is an authorization granted through a risk-based procedure for assessing unregistered (under development) vaccines or drugs during public health emergencies of international concern. It aims to expedite availability of the vaccine or drug to people affected by public health emergency based on essential set of available quality, safety and efficacy performance data."

Vaccine Safety,WHO,3/29/2021,How will we know if COVID-19 vaccines are safe?,"Ensuring the safety and quality of vaccines is one of WHOs highest priorities. WHO works closely with national authorities to ensure that global norms and standards are developed and implemented to assess the quality, safety and efficacy of vaccines.The process to develop COVID vaccines is fast-tracked while maintaining the highest standards: Given the urgent need to stop the pandemic, pauses between steps, often needed to secure funding, have been shortened, or eliminated, and in some cases, steps are being carried out in parallel to accelerate the process, wherever that is safe to do. COVID-19 vaccine developers have issued a joint pledge not to seek government approval for their vaccines until theyve been proven to be safe and effective.There are many strict protections in place to help ensure that COVID-19 vaccines are safe. Like all vaccines, COVID-19 vaccines are going through a rigorous, multi-stage testing process, including large (phase III) trials that involve tens of thousands of people. These trials, which include some groups at high risk for COVID-19 (certain groups like pregnant and lactating women were not included in vaccine trials), are specifically designed to identify any common side effects or other safety concerns.Once a clinical trial shows that a COVID-19 vaccine is safe and effective, a series of independent reviews of the efficacy and safety evidence is required, including regulatory review and approval in the country where the vaccine is manufactured, before WHO considers a vaccine product for EUL or prequalification. EUL or Prequalification verifies to those countries that would want to procure a particular vaccine that there has been an assurance by WHO that the regulatory review process, usually in the country of manufacture, has held up to the highest standards. Part of this process also involves a review of all the safety evidence by the Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety.An external panel of experts convened by WHO analyzes the results from clinical trials, along with evidence on the disease, age groups affected, risk factors for disease, and other information. The panel recommends whether and how the vaccines should be used. Officials in individual countries decide whether to approve the vaccines for national use and develop policies for how to use the vaccines in their country based on the WHO recommendations.After a COVID-19 vaccine is introduced, WHO supports work with vaccine manufacturers, health officials in each country, and other partners to monitor for any safety concerns on an ongoing basis."
Vaccine Safety,WHO,3/29/2021,How do we know that COVID-19 vaccines are safe?,"There are strict protections in place to help ensure the safety of all COVID-19 vaccines. Before receiving validation from WHO and national regulatory agencies, COVID-19 vaccines must undergo rigorous testing in clinical trials to prove that they meet internationally agreed benchmarks for safety and effectiveness. Unprecedented scientific collaborations have allowed COVID-19 vaccine research, development, and authorizations to be completed in record time to meet the urgent need for COVID-19 vaccines while maintaining high safety standards. As with all vaccines, WHO and regulatory authorities will continuously monitor the use of COVID-19 vaccines to confirm that they remain safe for all who receive them."

Vaccine Safety,WHO,3/29/2021,What are the side effects of COVID-19 vaccines?,"Like any vaccine, COVID-19 vaccines can cause mild side effects, such as a low-grade fever or pain or redness at the injection site. Most reactions to vaccines are mild and go away within a few days on their own. More serious or long-lasting side effects to vaccines are possible but extremely rare. Vaccines are continually monitored to detect rare adverse events. Reported side effects to COVID-19 vaccines have mostly been mild to moderate and short-lasting. They include: fever, fatigue, headache, muscle pain, chills, diarrhoea, and pain at the injection site. The chances of any of these side effects following vaccination differ according to the specific COVID-19 vaccine."
Vaccine Safety,WHO,3/29/2021,What is the link between COVID-19 vaccines and allergic reactions?,"WHO is aware of reports of severe allergic reactions in a small number of people who received a COVID-19 vaccine. A severe allergic reaction such as anaphylaxis is a potential but rare side effect with any vaccine. In persons with a known risk, such as previous experience of an allergic reaction to a previous dose of the vaccine or any of the known components in the vaccine, precautions may need to be taken. WHO recommends that healthcare providers assess patient medical history to determine if a patient is at risk for severe allergic reaction to a COVID-19 vaccine. All immunization providers should be trained to recognize severe allergic reactions and take practical steps to treat such reactions if they occur. COVID-19 vaccine use will be closely monitored by national authorities and international bodies, including WHO, to detect serious side effects, including any unexpected side effects. This will help us better understand and manage the specific risks of allergic reactions or other serious side effects to COVID-19 vaccines that may not have been detected during clinical trials, ensuring safe vaccination for all."

Vaccine Safety,WHO,3/29/2021,What happens if an adverse event is reported?,"As with any vaccine, it is essential to closely monitor the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines as they are delivered. If a problem is reported following vaccination, a thorough investigation should take place. During these investigations, it is extremely rare that health problems are found to be caused by the vaccine itself. Adverse events are most often found to be coincidental and may be entirely unrelated to vaccination. Sometimes they are related to how the vaccine has been stored, transported, or administered. Such errors can be prevented by better training health workers and strengthening supply chains. In the very rare cases where a genuine adverse reaction is suspected, the vaccine may be suspended from use. Further investigations will take place to determine what exactly caused the event, and corrective measures will be put in place. WHO works with vaccine manufacturers, health officials and other partners to monitor any safety concerns and potential side effects on an ongoing basis."
Vaccine Safety,WHO,3/29/2021,Under what circumstances should a COVID-19 vaccine be recalled?,"Vaccine recalls or withdrawals due to safety issues are rare. Recalls are usually initiated voluntarily by a vaccine manufacturer before any adverse events are reported. For example, ongoing monitoring of vaccine production may show that an irregularity has caused a batch of vaccines to lose their strength. In this case, people who have received a vaccine from that batch may need to be vaccinated again to ensure they are protected."

Vaccine Safety,WHO,3/29/2021,How will WHO inform the public about suspected or confirmed adverse events related to COVID-19 vaccines?,"Suspected safety events officially reported to WHO go through a series of rapid verification steps involving an independent panel of experts. WHO shares the results of these evaluations on its website. WHO also coordinates with local, regional, and national health officials to investigate vaccine safety concerns and advise on next steps. Information is also made available through the Vaccine Safety Net, a publicly available network of digital international resources on vaccine safety that have been approved by WHO."
Vaccine Safety,WHO,3/29/2021,"Is it safe for pregnant women, those planning to become pregnant, and breastfeeding mothers to receive COVID-19 vaccines?","Based on what we know about these vaccines, we dont have any specific reason to believe there will be risks that would outweigh the benefits of vaccination for pregnant women. While pregnancy puts women at higher risk of severe COVID-19, very little data are available to assess vaccine safety in pregnancy.For this reason, those pregnant women at high risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 (e.g., health workers) or who have comorbidities which add to their risk of severe disease may be vaccinated in consultation with their health care provider.It is not yet clear whether COVID-19 vaccines can be excreted through breastfeeding. To determine the best course of action, the developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mothers clinical need for immunization against COVID-19. WHO does not recommend discontinuing breastfeeding after vaccination."

Vaccine Safety,WHO,3/29/2021,How will WHO ensure vaccine safety monitoring and response when COVID-19 vaccines are used?,"Vaccine safety monitoring is ensured at the national, regional, and global level. As is standard practice in all national immunization programmes, WHO supports the set up of safety monitoring systems for COVID-19 vaccines in every country. After a COVID-19 vaccine is introduced in a country, WHO works with vaccine manufacturers, health officials and other partners to track safety concerns and potential side effects on an ongoing basis. Specific safety concerns that may arise will be evaluated by WHO and an independent group of experts (the Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety, or GACVS) in conjunction with the relevant national authorities."
Vaccine Safety,CDC,3/30/2021,Is it safe for me to get a COVID-19 vaccine if I would like to have a baby one day?,"If you are trying to become pregnant now or want to get pregnant in the future, you may receive a COVID-19 vaccine when one is available to you. There is currently no evidence that COVID-19 vaccination causes any problems with pregnancy, including the development of the placenta. In addition, there is no evidence that fertility problems are a side effect of any vaccine, including COVID-19 vaccines. Like all vaccines, scientists are studying COVID-19 vaccines carefully for side effects now and will continue to study them for many years."
Vaccine Safety,DOH,3/31/2021,What are the possible side effects of vaccination?,"Local reactions like pain, redness, and swelling at the injection site and flu-like symptoms including fever, headache, and fatigue are common after vaccination. These are signs that your body is buidling up the immune response from the vaccine. These symptoms will resolve in on to three days."

Vaccine Safety,DOH,3/31/2021,Are there risks for complications when given the COVID-19 vaccine?,"Like all other vaccines, there are risks of complications BUT SEVERE OR LIFE-THREATENING REACTIONS ARE EXTREMELY RARE. The benefit of protection against severe COVID-19 is greater than the risk. Anyone who will get the vaccine will be properly evaluated and closely monitored by health professionals to further minimize any risk."
Vaccine Safety,CDC,3/31/2021,What to Do if You Have an Allergic Reaction After Getting A COVID-19 Vaccine?,"If you had a severe allergic reaction—also known as anaphylaxis—after getting the first shot of a COVID-19 vaccine, CDC recommends that you not get a second shot of that vaccine. If the reaction was after an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine (either Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna), you should not get a second shot of either of these vaccines."

Vaccine Necessity,DOH,3/30/2021,What is the purpose of getting vaccinated?,"The COVID-19 pandemic has taken many lives, and continues to put many at risk. It has also disrupted the economy, leaving many Filipinos jobless or underemployed. With the availability of COVID-19 vaccines which can (1) prevent symptomatic infection and possibly (2) prevent severe infection and (3) prevent transmission, we have the opportunity to get ahead of the virus. However, like many vaccines being used in the past decades, the protective effect on our community is maximized only when at least 70% of the population get vaccinated. For example, if your barangay has 100,000 people, at least 70,000 should be vaccinated to ensure protection of the community. So remember, this is not just about getting you or your family vaccinated, this is about getting your barangay, city, province up for it."

Vaccine Efficacy,DOH,3/30/2021,Can i get COVID-19 even after I get vaccinated?,"Yes, there's still a possibility that you can get COVID-19 after you get vaccinated. But, vaccines can protect you from getting syptomatic (mild, moderate, and severe COVID-19). Further, it can prevent hospitalization and death from the disease."
Vaccine Efficacy,DOH,3/30/2021,Why did I acquire COVID-19 even when I'm vaccinted?,You might have been exposed to the virus through the following circumstances: Within 14 days before getting your first dose; in between your first and second doses; before your body had built up the protection from the vaccine; any gap in adhering to the BIDA behaviors and minimum public health standards.
Vaccine Efficacy,WHO,3/29/2021,Will COVID-19 vaccines provide long-term protection?,"Because COVID vaccines have only been developed in the past months, it's too early to know the duration of protection of COVID-19 vaccines. Research is ongoing to answer this question. However, its encouraging that available data suggest that most people who recover from COVID-19 develop an immune response that provides at least some period of protection against reinfection although were still learning how strong this protection is, and how long it lasts."

Vaccine Efficacy,WHO,3/29/2021,How quickly could COVID-19 vaccines stop the pandemic?,"The impact of COVID-19 vaccines on the pandemic will depend on several factors. These include the effectiveness of the vaccines; how quickly they are approved, manufactured, and delivered; the possible development of other variants and how many people get vaccinated. Whilst trials have shown several COVID-19 vaccines to have high levels of efficacy, like all other vaccines, COVID-19 vaccines will not be 100% effective. WHO is working to help ensure thatapproved vaccines are as effective as possible, so they can have the greatest impact on the pandemic."
Vaccine Efficacy,WHO,3/29/2021,What are the benefits of getting vaccinated?,"The COVID-19 vaccines produce protection against the disease, as a result of developing an immune response to the SARS-Cov-2 virus. Developing immunity through vaccination means there is a reduced risk of developing the illness and its consequences.This immunity helps you fight the virus if exposed. Getting vaccinated may also protect people around you,because if you are protected from getting infected and from disease, you are less likely to infect someone else. This is particularly important to protect people at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19, such as healthcare providers, older or elderly adults, and people with other medical conditions."
Vaccine Efficacy,WHO,3/29/2021,Is it possible that someone vaccinated against COVID-19 will still get infected?,"While several COVID-19 vaccines appear to have high levels of efficacy, no vaccine is 100% protective. As a result, there may be a small percentage of people who do not develop protection as expected after COVID-19 vaccination. In addition to a vaccine's specific characteristics, several factors such as a person's age, their underlying health conditions or previous exposure to COVID-19 may have an impact on a vaccines effectiveness. We also do not yet know how long immunity from different COVID-19 vaccines will last. That is one reason why, even as COVID-19 vaccines start to be rolled out, we must continue using all public health measures that work, such as physical distancing, masks, and handwashing."

Vaccine Efficacy,DOH,3/31/2021,How do vaccines prevent disease?,Vaccines mimic the virus or bacteria that causes disease and triggers the body’s creation of antibodies. These antibodies will provide protection once a person is infected with the actual disease-causing virus or bacteria.
Vaccine Distribution,WHO,3/29/2021,"As safe and effective vaccines for COVID-19 are approved, who should be the first to receive them?","WHO believes that everyone, everywhere who could benefit from safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines should have access as quickly as possible, starting with those at highest risk of serious disease or death. WHO's Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE) has released two key documents to help guide the allocation and prioritization of populations to receive COVID-19 vaccines: The Values Framework for the allocation and prioritization of COVID-19 vaccination, which offers high-level guidance globally on the values and ethical considerations regarding allocation of COVID-19 vaccines between countries, and offers guidance nationally on the prioritization of groups for vaccination within countries while supply is limited. The Roadmap for Prioritizing Population Groups for Vaccines against COVID-19, which recommends public health strategies and target priority groups for different levels of vaccine availability and epidemiologic settings. Examples of target priority groups include frontline health and care workers at high risk of infection, older adults, and those people at high risk of death because of underlying conditions like heart disease and diabetes.In addition, WHO led the development of a Fair Allocation Framework that aims to ensure that successful COVID-19 vaccines and treatments are shared equitably across all countries. This framework a key part of the Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator, a global collaboration to accelerate development, production, and equitable access to COVID-19 tests, treatments, and vaccines.The framework advises that as safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines are authorized for use, all countries should receive doses in proportion to their population size to immunize the highest-priority groups. In the second phase, vaccines would continue to be deployed to all countries so that additional populations can be covered according to national priorities."
Vaccine Distribution,WHO,3/29/2021,What is WHO doing to ensure that COVID-19 vaccines will be allocated fairly?,"WHO is one of the leaders of a global alliance known as COVAX, the vaccine pillar of the ACT-Accelerator collaboration, which is working to accelerate the development and manufacturing of COVID-19 vaccines and ensure that there is fair and equitable access to these vaccines for all countries.COVAX will allocate vaccines across countries according to a framework developed by a group that includes ethicists, scientists, and other health experts and vetted by WHOs Member States. Under this framework, COVID-19 vaccines will be rolled out in two phases. In the first phase, they will be allocated according to population size to all participating countries at the same time, so as to protect those people at greatest risk of infection and of severe disease.WHOs Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) has provided recommendations about which populations should be prioritized first. These include frontline health and care workers at high risk of infection, older adults, and those people at high risk of death because of underlying conditions like heart disease and diabetes. In the second phase of the roll-out, as more doses are produced, vaccines can go to groups less at risk of being infected or of suffering badly.COVAX aims to provide at least 2 billion vaccine doses by the end of 2021. The Facility has achieved that goal and additionally has the possibility to increase those doses by another 1 billion as right of first refusal for several candidates in clinical trials supported by CEPI. Although these doses are not enough for everyone in all countries, it may be enough to end the acute stage of the crisis and put the world on the road to ending the pandemic."
Vaccine Distribution,WHO,3/29/2021,How is WHO helping countries prepare for COVID-19 vaccines?,"Along with accelerating COVID-19 vaccine research and helping scale up manufacturing capacity, WHO is working in close partnership with countries, regional colleagues, and other partners to develop needed policies, strengthen regulatory capacity, training courses, and guide countries in all the needed preparations for a programme to deliver COVID-19 vaccines. WHO, UNICEF, and partners are supporting countries in preparing for COVID-19 vaccine introduction.TheCountryReadiness and Delivery workstream which is part of the ACT Accelerator hasdeveloped atoolboxwithguidance, tools, and trainings.For example, WHOs Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) has issued interim policy recommendations for the rollout of the first COVID-19 vaccine approved for emergency use, the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. These recommendations can guide and support country decision-making bodies, such as the National Immunization Technical Advisory Groups, on the optimal use of existing COVID-19 vaccines. SAGE is expected to review other vaccines in the coming months.WHO has also developed detailed technical guidance and adaptable planning tools and templates to help countries plan for COVID-19 vaccines considering the many aspects of readiness that need to be put in place. These areas include planning and implementation, data and monitoring, supply and logistics, and acceptance and demand. To support initial preparations, a vaccine introduction readiness assessment tool (VIRAT) has been developed and disseminated. It provides countries with an integrated roadmap of milestones and a framework for self-monitoring progress in preparing for vaccine introduction. This will help ensure that COVID-19 vaccines reach those in need as soon as they are available.WHO advises every country to develop a National Deployment and Vaccination Plan (NDVP) for COVID-19 vaccines. Having one plan in each country, that comprehensively describes all elements of the countrys approach to COVID-19 vaccine rollout will be crucial for a coordinated effort.Guidance on developing that planis available from WHO, including all elements that a country needs to consider."
Vaccine Distribution,WHO,3/29/2021,When will COVID-19 vaccines be ready for distribution?,"The first COVID-19 vaccines have already begun to be introduced in countries. Before COVID-19 vaccines can be delivered: The vaccines must be proven safe and effective in large (phase III) clinical trials. Some COVID-19 vaccine candidates have completed their phase III trials, andmany other potential vaccines are being developed.Independent reviews of the efficacy and safety evidence is required for each vaccine candidate, including regulatory review and approval in the country where the vaccine is manufactured, before WHO considers a vaccine candidate forprequalification. Part of this process also involves theGlobal Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety. In addition to review of the data for regulatory purposes, the evidence must also be reviewed for the purpose of policy recommendations on how the vaccines should be used.An external panel of expertsconvened by WHO, called the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE), analyzes the results from clinical trials, along with evidence on the disease, age groups affected, risk factors for disease, programmatic use, and other information. SAGE then recommends whether and how the vaccines should be used. Officials in individual countries decide whether to approve the vaccines for national use and develop policies for how to use the vaccines in their country based on the WHO recommendations. The vaccines must be manufactured in large quantities, which is a major and unprecedented challenge all the while continuing to produce all the other important life-saving vaccines already in use. As a final step, all approved vaccines will require distribution through a complex logistical process, with rigorous stock management and temperature control.WHO is working with partners aroundthe world to accelerate every step of this process, while also ensuring the highest safety standards are met. "
Vaccine Distribution,WHO,3/29/2021,Who should be excluded from receiving COVID-19 vaccines?,"Medical professionals can best advise individuals on whether or not they should receive a COVID-19 vaccine. However, based on available evidence, people with the following health conditions should generally be excluded from COVID-19 vaccination in order to avoid possible adverse effects: If you have a history of severe allergic reactions to any ingredients of the COVID-19 vaccine. If you are currently sick or experiencing symptoms of COVID-19, though you can get vaccinated once your primary symptoms have resolved. Further research is needed to determine the safety and efficacy of different COVID-19 vaccines in certain population groups. In addition to the general recommendations above, each vaccine may have specific considerations for specific populations and health conditions."
Vaccine Distribution,DOH,3/31/2021,What can I do while waiting for the arrival of vaccines?,"The public should scrutinize and carefully evaluate information about COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccination found online. Make it a habit to fact-check and verify from reputable sources. Continue observing minimum public health standards to prevent the spread of the virus.

In the past, vaccines have been developed through a series of steps that can take many years. Now, given the urgent need for COVID-19 vaccines, unprecedented financial investments and scientific collaborations are changing how vaccines are developed. This means that some of the steps in the research and development process have been happening in parallel, while still maintaining strict clinical and safety standards. For example, some clinical trials are evaluating multiple vaccines at the same time. However, this does not make the studies any less rigorous."

Vaccine Development,WHO,3/29/2021,What are human challenge studies? What is WHOs view on these studies?,"In a regular vaccine study, one group of volunteers at risk for a disease is given an experimental vaccine, and another group is not; researchers monitor both groups over time and compare outcomes to see if the vaccine is safe and effective. In a human challenge vaccine study, healthy volunteers are given an experimental vaccine, and then deliberately exposed to the organism causing the disease to see if the vaccine works. Some scientists believe that this approach could accelerate COVID-19 vaccine development, in part because it would require far fewer volunteers than a typical study. However, there are important ethical considerations that must be addressed particularly for a new disease like COVID-19, which we do not yet fully understand and are still learning how to treat; it may be difficult for the medical community and potential volunteers to properly estimate the potential risks of participating in a COVID-19 human challenge study.

In a human challenge vaccine study, healthy volunteers are given an experimental vaccine, and then deliberately exposed to the organism causing the disease to see if the vaccine works. Some scientists believe that this approach could accelerate COVID-19 vaccine development, in part because it would require far fewer volunteers than a typical study. However, there are important ethical considerations that must be addressed particularly for a new disease like COVID-19, which we do not yet fully understand and are still learning how to treat; it may be difficult for the medical community and potential volunteers to properly estimate the potential risks of participating in a COVID-19 human challenge study. "
Vaccine Development,WHO,3/29/2021,Who should participate in clinical trials for COVID-19 vaccines?,"Small (phase I) safety studies of COVID-19 vaccines should enroll healthy adult volunteers. Larger (phase II and III) studies should include volunteers that reflect the populations for whom the vaccines are intended. This means enrolling people from diverse geographic areas, racial and ethnic backgrounds, genders, and ages, as well as those with underlying health conditions that put them at higher risk for COVID-19. Including these groups in clinical trials is the only way to make sure that a vaccine will be safe and effective for everyone who needs it."
Vaccine Development,WHO,3/29/2021,How do I volunteer for a COVID-19 vaccine trial?,"Opportunities to volunteer for a COVID-19 vaccine trial vary from country to country. If you are interested in volunteering, check with local health officials or research institutions."
Vaccine Development,WHO,3/29/2021,What types of COVID-19 vaccines are being developed? How would they work?,"Scientists around the world are developing many potential vaccines for COVID-19. These vaccines are all designed to teach the body's immune system to safely recognize and block the virus that causes COVID-19. Several different types of potential vaccines for COVID-19 are in development, including: Inactivated or weakened virus vaccines, which use a form of the virus that has been inactivated or weakened so it doesn't cause disease, but still generates an immune response. Protein-based vaccines, which use harmless fragments of proteins or protein shells that mimic the COVID-19 virus to safely generate an immune response. Viral vector vaccines, which use a safe virus that cannot cause disease but serves as a platform to produce coronavirus proteins to generate an immune response. RNA and DNA vaccines, a cutting-edge approach that uses genetically engineered RNA or DNA to generate a protein that itself safely prompts an immune response."

Vaccines General Info,DOH,3/31/2021,What if I do not want to get vaccinated?,"Vaccination is not mandatory. But the government highly encourages the public to get vaccinated and be protected against preventable disease. The COVID-19 pandemic has taken many lives, and continues to put many at risk. It has also disrupted the economy, leaving many Filipinos jobless or underemployed. With the availability of COVID-19 vaccines which can (1) prevent symptomatic infection and possibly (2) prevent severe infection and (3) prevent transmission, we have the opportunity to get ahead of the virus. However, like many vaccines being used in the past decades, the protective effect on our community is maximized only when at least 70% of the population get vaccinated. For example, if your barangay has 100,000 people, at least 70,000 should be vaccinated to ensure protection of the community. So remember, this is not just about getting you or your family vaccinated, this is about getting your barangay, city, province up for it."
Getting Vaccinated,DOH,3/31/2021,What to do before getting vaccinated?,"While we wait for the vaccines to arrive, make sure you obtain accurate information only from the right sources. Ask only licensed medical professionals so that you are correctly advised regarding COVID-19 vaccination. Verify things you may have read or heard. It is only when you are armed with the right information can you rightfully decide yourself if you will be vaccinated. Your health history will be crucial in determining whether you should get vaccinated or what vaccines are appropriate for you. It is therefore important that you take the health screening seriously. Show up on the day of your screening and declare your complete medical history (e.g. allergies, risky behavior). The health care professional will only be able to assess you correctly if you provide the correct information. If you did not undergo screening, you will not be booked or scheduled for vaccination."

Getting Vaccinated,DOH,3/31/2021,What to do on the day of the vaccination?,"Go to your assigned vaccination site on time - of course wearing your mask and face shield. Before getting your shot, you will sign an informed consent form signifying your willingness to be vaccinated and that you are aware of the benefits and risks of the vaccine. Follow the minimum health standards protocols in your vaccination site to keep everyone safe (e.g. physical distancing appropriately). Immediately after being vaccinated, you will receive your vaccination card and you will be asked to stay in the facility for 1 hour before you can go home. This is to allow your health care providers to monitor if you will experience any unusual symptoms, or what we call adverse events.  Because we take safety seriously, monitoring will continue for until 12 months after you get your shot."
Getting Vaccinated,DOH,3/31/2021,What to do after vaccination?,"You may experience some side effects, similar to having the flu but this should go away in a few days. Don’t worry, this is a normal sign that your body is building protection. In most cases, discomfort from fever or pain is normal but do contact your health care provider if the redness or tenderness where you got the shot increases after 24 hours or if your side effects are worrying you or do not seem to be going away after a few days. It is important that you report to the health authorities so experts can study whether the adverse event was indeed a result of vaccination or a mere coincidence. We don’t want to worry the public unnecessarily. Also, with most COVID-19 vaccines, you will need 2 shots in order for you to get the promised protection. Get the second shot even if you have side effects after the first shot, unless your healthcare provider tells you not to get a second shot."

Getting Vaccinated,Healthline,3/31/2021,Why do I need to get two doses?,"During early studies, researchers found that the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines provoke a relatively weak immune response when given as just one dose. However, there was a stronger immune response when a second dose was added. Basically, the first dose of the vaccine starts the process of building up protection. The second dose works to greatly reinforce this protection."
Getting Vaccinated,Healthline,3/31/2021,Can I only get the first dose?,"During early studies, researchers found that the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines provoke a relatively weak immune response when given as just one dose. However, there was a stronger immune response when a second dose was added. Basically, the first dose of the vaccine starts the process of building up protection. The second dose works to greatly reinforce this protection."
Getting Vaccinated,Healthline,3/31/2021,Can I just get one dose of vaccine?,"During early studies, researchers found that the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines provoke a relatively weak immune response when given as just one dose.

Getting Vaccinated,CDC,3/31/2021,Can I take different vaccine brands?,"The CDC has recommended that people get the same version because that is what the data in the clinical trials were based on. However, they have indicated that “in exceptional circumstances” if the same version is not available, a person can, for example, get the Pfizer vaccine first and the Moderna vaccine second. The two doses should be separated by at least 28 days if different brands are used. However, people who got the first dose of an mRNA vaccine should not switch to the adenovirus version (Johnson & Johnson/Janssen). The best-case scenario would be that most people will be able to get the second dose from the same vaccine maker as their first dose."

Vaccine Brands,FDA,3/31/2021,What data did the FDA use to make the decision to authorize Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine for emergency use?,"It is not uncommon for FDA to update a LOA when new information regarding an authorized product becomes available and such a revision is appropriate to protect the public health or safety. As noted, there were several updates to the LOA, and the agency reissued the updated LOA in order to provide transparency about the EUA. There are no changes to the agency's determination that the vaccine's known and potential benefits outweigh its known and potential risks."
Vaccine Brands,FDA,3/31/2021,What data is available to the public to review?,"Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine is authorized to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in individuals 16 years of age and older.FDA evaluated and analyzed the safety and effectiveness data from clinical trials conducted in tens of thousands of study participants and manufacturing information submitted by Pfizer-BioNTech. FDA has determined that the totality of the available data provides clear evidence that Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine may be effective in preventing COVID-19 and support that the known and potential benefits outweigh the known and potential risks of the vaccine's use in millions of people 16 years of age and older, including healthy individuals."
Vaccine Brands,FDA,3/31/2021,How well does Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine prevent COVID-19?,"FDA posted data and analysis in a briefing document made available in connection with the December 10, 2020, meeting of the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee. Following issuance of the emergency use authorization, the Letter of Authorization, Fact Sheets and Full EUA Prescribing Information are posted on FDA's web site. FDA has also posted the review memo for Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, which summarizes FDA's review of the safety and effectiveness data, including clinical data, submitted in support of the request for emergency use authorization."
Vaccine Brands,FDA,3/31/2021,How long will the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine provide protection?,"The data to support the EUA include an analysis of 36,523 participants in the ongoing randomized, placebo-controlled international study, the majority of whom are U.S. participants, who completed the 2-dose vaccination regimen and did not have evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection through 7 days after the second dose. Among these participants, 18,198 received the vaccine and 18,325 received saline placebo. The vaccine was 95 percent effective in preventing COVID-19 disease among these clinical trial participants with 8 COVID-19 cases in the vaccine group and 162 COVID-19 cases in the placebo group. Of these 170 COVID-19 cases, 1 in the vaccine group and 3 in the placebo group were classified as severe."
Vaccine Brands,FDA,3/31/2021,Is the the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine effective at reducing the severity of COVID-19?,Data are not yet available to inform about the duration of protection that the vaccine will provide.
Vaccine Brands,FDA,3/31/2021,Can people who have already had COVID-19 get the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine?,"To date, only a small number of severe cases have occurred during the study, which makes it difficult to evaluate whether the vaccine reduces the severity of COVID-19. Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine is authorized to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in individuals 16 years of age and older."
Vaccine Brands,FDA,3/31/2021,"If a person has received the the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, will the vaccine protect against transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from individuals who are infected despite vaccination?","Among all study participants, 3% had evidence of infection prior to vaccination, and among participants with evidence of infection prior to vaccination, more confirmed COVID-19 cases occurred in the placebo group compared with the vaccine group. While relatively few confirmed COVID-19 cases occurred overall among participants with evidence of infection prior to vaccination, available data suggest that previously infected individuals can be at risk of COVID-19 (i.e., reinfection) and could benefit from vaccination."
Vaccine Brands,FDA,3/31/2021,How can we be so sure about the effectiveness of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine when people participating in the trial were doing some level of mitigation (whether personal or government recommended)?,"Most vaccines that protect from viral illnesses also reduce transmission of the virus that causes the disease by those who are vaccinated. While it is hoped this will be the case, the scientific community does not yet know if the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine will reduce such transmission."
Vaccine Brands,FDA,3/31/2021,Did clinical trial participation include members of racial or ethnic groups at greater risk from COVID-19?,"In a randomized, blinded clinical trial, participants are not aware of whether they received vaccine or placebo. Therefore, any mitigation efforts would have affected those who received vaccine and placebo equally. The relatively high infection rate among placebo recipients suggests that that any mitigation efforts among trial participants may not have been very effective."
Vaccine Brands,FDA,3/31/2021,Can pregnant or breastfeeding women receive the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine?,"Yes. Overall, among the total participants who received either Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine or placebo, 9.1 percent were Black or African American, 28.0 percentwere Hispanic/Latino, 4.3 percentwere Asian, and 0.5 percentwere American Indian/Alaska native."
Vaccine Brands,FDA,3/31/2021,Can children receive the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine?,"While there have been no specific studies in these groups, there is no contraindication to receipt of the vaccine for pregnant or breastfeeding women. Pregnant or breastfeeding women should discuss potential benefits and risks of vaccination with their healthcare provider."
Vaccine Brands,FDA,3/31/2021,What safety information did FDA evaluate to authorize the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine for emergency use?,Individuals 16 and 17 years of age may receive the vaccine. The EUA includes use in individuals 16 and older. Adolescents 16 to 17 years of age were included in the efficacy analysis and one confirmed COVID-19 case was reported in this age group. FDA has determined that it is biologically reasonable to extrapolate that safety and effectiveness in ages 16-17 years would be similar to safety and effectiveness in younger adults.
Vaccine Brands,FDA,3/31/2021,Is information available about serious adverse events?,"The available safety data to support the EUA include 37,586 of the participants enrolled in an ongoing randomized, placebo-controlled international study, the majority of whom are U.S. participants. These participants, 18,801 of whom received the vaccine and 18,785 of whom received saline placebo, were followed for a median of 2 months after receiving the 2nd dose. This is consistent with the recommendations set forth in FDA's October 2020 Guidance on Emergency Use Authorization for Vaccines to Prevent COVID-19.The most commonly reported side effects were pain at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle pain, chills, joint pain, and fever. Side effects typically started within two days of vaccination and resolved 1-2 day later. Of note, more people experienced these side effects after the second dose than after the first dose, so it is important for vaccination providers and recipients to expect that that there may be some side effects after either dose, but even more so after the second dose.FDA also evaluated additional safety data from the larger database that included participants enrolled later during the study who had shorter follow-up (the total database included 43,448 participants, 21,720 of whom received vaccine and 21,728 of whom received saline placebo) . FDA determined that the findings were similar to those in the population of participants with a median follow-up of 2 months after the 2nd dose."
Vaccine Brands,FDA,3/31/2021,Are vaccine providers required to report side effects?,"Serious adverse events, while uncommon (<1.0%), were observed at slightly higher numerical rates in the vaccine study group compared to the saline placebo study group, both overall and for certain specific adverse events occurring in very small numbers. These represented common medical events that occur in the general population at similar frequency. Upon further review by FDA, these imbalances do not raise a safety concern, nor do they suggest a causal relationship to vaccination for the vast majority of reported serious adverse events.Serious adverse events considered by FDA to be plausibly related to the vaccine or vaccination procedure were one case of shoulder injury at the vaccination site and one case of swollen lymph node in the armpit opposite the vaccination arm.No safety concerns were identified in subgroup analyses by age, race, ethnicity, medical comorbidities, or prior SARS-CoV-2 infection.Severe allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported following administration of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine during mass vaccination outside of the clinical trial setting. Information pertaining to severe allergic reaction is included in the Fact Sheet for Vaccine Providers, Fact Sheet for Vaccine Recipients and the EUA Prescribing Information.Additional adverse reactions, some of which may be serious, may become apparent with more widespread use of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine."
Vaccine Brands,FDA,3/31/2021,Must vaccine providers give a hard copy of the authorized Recipient and Caregiver Fact Sheetto the individual when they get their shot?,Providers administering Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine must report to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) and to Pfizer the following information associated with the vaccine of which they become aware:Vaccine administration errors whether or not associated with an adverse eventSerious adverse events (irrespective of attribution to vaccination)Cases of Multisystem Inflammatory SyndromeCases of COVID-19 that result in hospitalization or death
Vaccine Brands,FDA,3/31/2021,Can the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine protect recipients after a single dose?,"The EUA requires vaccination providers, prior to the individual receiving the vaccine, to communicate to the recipient or their caregiver information consistent with the â€œFact Sheet for Recipients and Caregivers,â€ and either to provide a copy of the Fact Sheet or to direct the individual to the website (https://www.cvdvaccine.com/) to obtain the Fact Sheet."
Vaccine Brands,FDA,3/31/2021,Are the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine and the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine interchangeable?,"The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine is administered intramuscularly as a series of two doses (0.3 mL each) 3 weeks apart. The vaccine was not studied for use as a single dose.FDA's conclusions regarding the safety and effectiveness of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, and the Agency's determination that the criteria for an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) were met, were based on the evidence generated by the clinical trials that studied two doses and are reflected in conditions described in the emergency use authorization (EUA).Individuals who have received one dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine should receive a second dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine on schedule to complete the vaccination series."
Vaccine Brands,FDA,3/31/2021,Can you describe the mRNA technology of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine? Are there any safety concerns considering the â€œnewnessâ€ of this technology?,"No. There are no data available on the interchangeability of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine with other COVID-19 vaccines, including Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine. Individuals who have received one dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine should receive a second dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine to complete the vaccination series.Individuals who have received one dose of Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine should receive a second dose of Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine to complete the vaccination series."
Vaccine Brands,FDA,3/31/2021,Can the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine cause infertility in women?,"The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine is a messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine. The vaccine contains a synthetic, small piece of the SARS-CoV-2 genetic material (mRNA) that instructs cells in the body to make the virus's distinctive ""spike""protein. When vaccinated, the body produces copies of the spike protein, which alone does not cause disease, and the immune system learns to react defensively, producing an immune response against SARS-CoV-2.Although this technology has not been used in any FDA-licensed preventive vaccine, FDA scientists have expertise with this technology as it has been used to develop other preventive investigational vaccines that have been tested in human clinical trials. FDA does not have specific safety concerns with a vaccine that utilizes this technology."
Vaccine Brands,FDA,3/31/2021,What materials about the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine is FDA making available to vaccine providers and vaccine recipients?,"There is no scientific evidence to suggest that the vaccine could cause infertility in women. In addition, infertility is not known to occur as a result of natural COVID-19 disease, further demonstrating that immune responses to the virus, whether induced by infection or a vaccine, are not a cause of infertility. Reports on social media have falsely asserted that the vaccine could cause infertility in women and the FDA is concerned that this misinformation may cause women to avoid vaccination to prevent COVID-19, which is a potentially serious and life-threatening disease. SARS-CoV-2 is the virus that causes COVID-19. The symptoms of COVID-19 vary and are unpredictable; many people have no symptoms or only mild disease, while some have severe respiratory disease including pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), leading to multi-organ failure and death. The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine is a mRNA vaccine. It contains a small piece of the SARS-CoV-2 virus's genetic material that instructs cells in the body to make the virus's distinctive â€œspikeâ€ protein. After a person is vaccinated, their body produces copies of the spike protein, which does not cause disease, and triggers the immune system to learn to react defensively, producing an immune response against SARS-CoV-2. Contrary to false reports on social media, this protein is not the same as any involved in formation of the placenta."
Vaccine Brands,FDA,3/31/2021,How will additional safety monitoring be conducted for the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine?,"Fact Sheet for Recipients and Caregivers Fact Sheet for Vaccination Providers, which also includes Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) Prescribing Information FDA's Decision Memorandum"
Vaccine Brands,FDA,3/31/2021,How will additional data on the effectiveness of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine be obtained?,"The company has submitted a pharmacovigilance plan to FDA to monitor the safety of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine. The pharmacovigilance plan includes a plan to complete longer-term safety follow-up for participants enrolled in ongoing clinical trials. The pharmacovigilance plan also includes other activities aimed at monitoring the safety profile of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine and ensuring that any safety concerns are identified and evaluated in a timely manner.Responsibility for additional post-authorization vaccine safety monitoring will be shared primarily by FDA and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), along with other agencies involved in healthcare delivery. Post-authorization safety monitoring during the COVID-19 pandemic vaccination program will aim to continuously monitor the safety of COVID-19 vaccines to rapidly detect safety problems if they exist. There will be multiple, complementary systems in place with validated analytic methods that can rapidly detect signals for possible vaccine safety problems. The U.S. government has a well-established post-authorization/post-approval vaccine safety monitoring infrastructure that will be scaled up to meet the needs of a large-scale COVID-19 vaccination program. The U.S. government â€“ in partnership with health systems, academic centers, and private sector partners â€“ will use multiple existing vaccine safety monitoring systems to monitor COVID-19 vaccines in the post-authorization/approval period. Some of these systems are the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), the Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD), the Biologics Effectiveness and Safety (BEST) Initiative, and Medicare claims data."
Vaccine Brands,FDA,3/31/2021,How does the vaccine go from authorized for emergency use to licensed (approved)?,"Additional data on vaccine effectiveness will be generated from further follow-up of participants in clinical studies already underway before the EUA was issued, plus studies conducted by the manufacturer or by the U.S. government evaluating effectiveness of the vaccine as used under the EUA."
Vaccine Brands,FDA,3/31/2021,"Does the FDA foresee any instance in which a vaccine might receive an EUA and not meet the criteria for a Biologics License Application (BLA)? If a product doesn't meet the BLA standard, does the EUA get revoked?","It is FDA's expectation that, following submission of an EUA request and issuance of an EUA, the manufacturer would continue to collect placebo-controlled data in any ongoing trials for as long as feasible to obtain additional safety and effectiveness information and would also work towards submission of a Biologics License Application (BLA) as soon as possible."
Vaccine Brands,FDA,3/31/2021,How long will it take to get to a BLA? When does the clock start to get a BLA?,"If safety or effectiveness concerns arise with a vaccine under EUA, FDA has the authority to revoke the EUA. However, it is expected that the data supporting the EUA, together with those that will be collected during use of vaccine under EUA, and additional data collected from ongoing trials will be sufficient to support licensure (approval) of a vaccine authorized under EUA."
Vaccine Brands,FDA,3/31/2021,What happens to other vaccines being studied?,We cannot predict how long it will take for the manufacturer to submit a Biologics License Application (BLA). There is no â€œclockâ€ for the submission of a BLA to FDA after issuance of an EUA or completion of clinical trials.
Vaccine Brands,FDA,3/31/2021,Is it feasible to conduct placebo-controlled trials of COVID-19 vaccines after a vaccine is made available under an EUA?,FDA believes it is important for clinical trials for other COVID-19 vaccines to continue or initiate. It is important to have a portfolio of COVID-19 vaccines available to be able to vaccinate our population.
Vaccine Brands,FDA,3/31/2021,Who made the decision to authorize the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine for emergency use?,"FDA believes it is feasible to conduct placebo-controlled trials of COVID-19 vaccines after another vaccine is made available under an EUA, especially if that vaccine is not available in sufficient quantity for everyone who wants to receive it. Additionally, it may be feasible to conduct trials where safety and effectiveness of one or more COVID-19 vaccines are evaluated against a comparator COVID-19 vaccine that has been authorized for use under an EUA."
Vaccine Brands,FDA,3/31/2021,How are you going to educate the public about the safety and effectiveness of the the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine?,"FDA's career scientists and physicians in the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research made a determination that the emergency use authorization request met the criteria for issuing an EUA. Our Chief Scientist, RADM Denise Hinton, signed the authorization."
Vaccine Brands,FDA,3/31/2021,"Now that the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine is available, will the public still need to be vigilant and practice public health measures?","FDA has been embarking on an education campaign via social media, consumer content, media interviews, engagement with stakeholders and more to help the public understand our regulatory and scientific processes. These engagements will continue."
Vaccine Brands,FDA,3/31/2021,"Previously, there were reports that vials of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine contained extra product after five doses of vaccine was obtained from a vial. The original letter of authorization (LOA) said that each vial contains 5 doses of 0.3 mL per dose. What's different with the latest version of the Fact Sheet regarding the number of doses per vial?","Yes. Because the vaccine will not be available immediately for most of the population, it will still be necessary to continue with the public health measures that we have been following. The best way to prevent illness is to avoid being exposed to the virus. The CDC recommends the following preventive actions:Wash your hands often with plain soap and water. The CDC recommends washing your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after you have been in a public place, or after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing. If soap and water are not available, the CDC recommends using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60 percent alcohol. Learn more about safely using hand sanitizer.Cover your mouth and nose with a cloth face covering or non-surgical mask when around others.Avoid crowds and practice social distancing (stay at least 6 feet apart from others)."
Vaccine Brands,FDA,3/31/2021,What other changes or updates were made to the letter of authorization for Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine?,"FDA previously advised that it is acceptable to use every full dose obtainable from each vial (the sixth, or possibly even a seventh), pending resolution of the issue of how many full doses are obtainable per vial of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine.â€¯FDA also advised that any further product remaining that does not constitute a full dose should not be pooled from multiple vials to create one.Pfizer has submitted requests to FDA for the EUA to clarify the number of doses obtainable per vial of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. In order to provide flexibility to vaccine providers, FDA updated the Letter of Authorization for the EUA for the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine to remove reference to the number of doses contained in one vial after dilution. The Agency also updated the Fact Sheet for Healthcare Providers Administering Vaccine (Vaccination Providers) to note that, after dilution, one vial of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine contains six doses of 0.3 mL. This updated Fact Sheet for Vaccination Providers also notes that low dead-volume syringes and/or needles can be used to extract six doses from a single vial. If standard syringes and needles are used, there may not be sufficient volume to extract a sixth dose from a single vial.Given that the original Letter of Authorization noted that each vial contained 5 doses, we recognize that some vial labels and cartons may state that after dilution, a vial contains 5 doses of 0.3 mL. The information in the Fact Sheet regarding the number of doses per vial after dilution supersedes the number of doses stated on vial labels and cartons.Because the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine does not contain preservative, it is critical to note that any further remaining product that does not constitute a full dose should not be pooled from multiple vials to create one dose. The updated information in the revised Fact Sheet for Vaccination Providers should address any questions or confusion about whether these additional full doses may be used."
Vaccine Brands,FDA,3/31/2021,The reissued LOA also mentions that changes pertaining to safety monitoring were made to the Fact Sheet for Healthcare Providers Administering Vaccine Vaccination Providersand the Fact Sheet for Recipients and Caregivers. What were these changes?,The reissued LOA includes updated language (found at letter â€œTâ€ of the LOA) to clarify the instructions for reporting adverse events to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS).
Vaccine Brands,FDA,3/31/2021,Why did FDA revise and issue a new LOA when the agency already posted information about the potential for extra doses in the vials?,"The Fact Sheet for Healthcare Providers Administering Vaccine (Vaccination Providers) was updated to include in the Warnings section reference to guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for monitoring Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine recipients for the occurrence of immediate adverse reactions. This is in addition to the warning that appropriate medical treatment used to manage immediate allergic reactions must be immediately available in the event an acute anaphylactic reaction occurs following administration of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine. Severe allergic reactions have been reported following the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine during mass vaccination outside of the clinical trial setting.The Fact Sheet for Healthcare Providers Administering Vaccine (Vaccination Providers) was also updated to instruct vaccination providers to provide information about v-safe to vaccine recipients. V-safe is a new voluntary smartphone-based tool that uses text messaging and web surveys to check in with people who have been vaccinated to identify potential side effects after COVID-19 vaccination.The original Fact Sheet for Recipients and Caregivers informed vaccine recipients about a remote chance that the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine could cause a severe allergic reaction soon after vaccination. The Fact Sheet for Recipients and Caregivers was updated to inform vaccine recipients that because of the possibility of allergic reactions, their vaccination provider may ask them to stay at the place where they received their vaccine for monitoring after vaccination. The Fact Sheet for Recipients and Caregivers was also updated to provide information on v-safe."

As of March 05, 2021, only Pfizer, AstraZeneca, and Sinovac have been issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) by the Philippine FDA."
Vaccine Brands,DOH,3/31/2021,CAN A PERSON DECLINE THE VACCINATION?,"Yes. Vaccination is not mandatory and anyone may opt to decline. Refusal to vaccination, however, will subject the vaccinee to a rescheduling process according to the prioritization framework for COVID-19 vaccination. For persons who will refuse vaccination onsite, reason/s for refusal may be documented using the informed consent form.

Note that for Sinovac, in accordance with the Philippine Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and interim National Immunization Technical Advisory Group (iNITAG) recommendations, healthcare frontliners reserve the right to choose and may refuse vaccination without losing his/her slot in the priority list."
Vaccine Brands,DOH,3/31/2021,WHEN WILL THE COVID-19 VACCINE BE AVAILABLE?,"The government is currently in the initial phase of vaccine rollout with the availability of Sinovac and AstraZeneca vaccines in the country.

Getting Vaccinated,DOH,3/31/2021,"IF A PERSON EXPERIENCED AN ANAPHYLACTIC REACTION FROM THE 1ST DOSE OF A SPECIFIC VACCINE BRAND, CAN THEY GET ANOTHER BRAND? IF YES, HOW LONG SHOULD THE INTERVAL BE?","Based on the Philippine FDA EUA of available vaccines here in the Philippines, occurrence of anaphylactic reaction after the 1st dose of COVID-19 vaccine is not advised for the inoculation of the 2nd dose of that vaccine type. Additionally, interchangeability of vaccine products is not recommended due to limited availability of scientific evidence."
Vaccine Distribution,DOH,3/31/2021,"WHICH HEALTHCARE WORKERS CAN SERVE AS VACCINATORS (PHARMACISTS, MIDWIVES, ETC.) AND HOW WILL THEY BE TRAINED FOR THIS?","This will still be finalized with DOH, PRC, and concerned organizations. Details are still being finalized for training, should there be a need for these (i.e. for pharmacists who did not acquire vaccination skills in their undergraduate studies). Healthcare workers will be updated through their respective networks/channels on next steps regarding this."
Getting Vaccinated,DOH,3/31/2021,HOW WILL SCREENING BE CONDUCTED PRIOR TO VACCINATION?,"At the screening area, the personnel assigned shall scan the individual's QR or Unique Code before they are clinically assessed for COVID-19 symptoms, comorbidities, and other important clinical information. Contraindications and precautions stated in the EUA issued by the Philippine FDA shall be followed for all vaccines.

Specific health screening (e.g. age, allergy to vaccine components) may be adopted per vaccine and shall be issued in vaccine-specific guidelines. Likewise, health screening shall follow clinical practice guidelines of medical societies, which shall be regularly updated based on best available evidence."
Getting Vaccinated,DOH,3/31/2021,WHO WILL CONDUCT THE SCREENING PRIOR TO VACCINATION?,"Using both the VIMS Vaccination Post System (VPS) and hard copy of the screening form, health workers shall update the profile of potential vaccine recipients and determine whether or not they are eligible for vaccination."
Getting Vaccinated,DOH,3/31/2021,HOW LONG BEFORE VACCINATION SHOULD SCREENING BE DONE?,"Individuals not belonging to special populations, like those who are immunodeficient or senior citizens with special conditions (i.e. bedridden, in vegetative state, with limited life expectancy), may have their health profiling, provision of informed consent, and screening on the same day of vaccination. Otherwise, they shall first obtain medical clearance from their attending physicians to discuss vaccine-specific risks and benefits."
Getting Vaccinated,DOH,3/31/2021,WHAT SITES OR AREAS WILL BE DESIGNATED AS VACCINATION SITES OR IMPLEMENTING UNITS FOR THE VACCINATION PROGRAM?,"”Implementing units”are those allowed to conduct vaccination activities.
